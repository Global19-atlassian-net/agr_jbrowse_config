The experiments were done using RNA isolated from 'mix stage' wild-type N2 worms. SL1 and SL2 were used as 5' universal primers for 5'RACE experiments. The 'RST's' (i.e., RACE Sequence Tags), are 5' reads from cloned RACE products (sequenced as minipools). Sequences are vector trimmed then quality trimmed (SL sequences are not removed from 5' RST's). In quality trimming, the first sliding window of 20 nt long with an average quality score higher than 15 marks the start of good quality sequences. Likewise, the first sliding window of 20 nt with average quality score lower than 15 marks the end of good quality sequences.
